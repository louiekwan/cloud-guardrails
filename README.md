# GC Cloud Guardrails for Public Sectors

This project will host the minimum guardrails as part of the Cloud Operationalization Framework.

## Purpose

The purpose of the guardrails is to ensure that our clients are implementing a preliminary baseline set of controls within their cloud-based environments. 

## Summary - Initial stage

A summary of the cloud guardrails to be implemented in the initial phase are identified in the table below:

| ID. | Cloud Guardrails |
| --- | --- |
| 01 | [Protect root / global admins account](EN/01_Protect-Root-Account.md) |
| 02 | [Management of administrative privileges](EN/02_Management-Admin-Privileges.md) |
| 03 | [Cloud console access](EN/03_Cloud-Console-Access.md) |
| 04 | [Enterprise monitoring accounts](EN/04_Enterprise-Monitoring-Accounts.md) |
| 05 | [Data location](EN/05_Data-Location.md) |
| 06 | [Protection of data-at-rest](EN/06_Protect-Data-at-Rest.md) |
| 07 | [Protection of data-in-transit](EN/07_Protect-Data-in-Transit.md) |
| 08 | [Segment and separate](EN/08_Segmentation.md) |
| 09 | [Network security services](EN/09_Network-Security-Services.md) |
| 10 | [Cyber defense services](EN/10_Cyber-Defense-Services.md) |
| 11 | [Logging and monitoring](EN/11_Logging-and-Monitoring.md) |
| 12 | [Configuration of cloud marketplaces](EN/12_Cloud-Marketplace-Config.md) |

The [applicable scope for the guardrails](EN/00_Applicable-Scope.md) for the guardrails are based on cloud usage profiles.

## Post 30 Days from GC Cloud guidelines

GC clients are expected to continue implementing the security requirements as outlined in:

* [Direction on the Secure Use of Commercial Cloud Services: Security Implementation Notice (SPIN)](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-government-innovations/cloud-services/direction-secure-use-commercial-cloud-services-spin.html)
* [Government of Canada Security Control Profile for Cloud-Based GC Services](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-government-innovations/cloud-services/government-canada-security-control-profile-cloud-based-it-services.html)

Departments should engage with their IT Security Risk Management teams to obtain advice and guidance on integrating security assessment and authorization activities as part of the implementation of the GC cloud environment. The [Government of Canada Cloud Security Risk Management Approach and Procedures](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-government-innovations/cloud-services/cloud-security-risk-management-approach-procedures.html) outlines activities for Departments to consider as part of the departmental risk management activities.
